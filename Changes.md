# Changes

What could be changed?

The two cards could be in an absolute flex container with margins / padding.
  That flex container could be stretched on mobile to take 100vw and two cards could have space between, thus achieving a nice effect.
  Additionaly that would allow for the two cards to not be cut off when for example right: 100px or smth like that. 

 ~~The backgorund could be treated as an element with set size (on mobile backgound would act as a simple header) 
  That would assure that the backgorund would not change according to vh of a device, I would not use grid
  
 Use rem & em
